# Basketball Statistics Database
<a href="https://996.icu"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/link-996.icu-red.svg" alt="996.icu" /></a>
<h4> Description </h4>
Our website will be a Basketball statistics database, with options for the user to select a favorite set of teams to focus on. It will contain live match data, past match statistics, and player statistics as needed by the user, who is most likely an avid follower of the NBA. With the data stored (player data, team data, user data), it will generate all kinds of analytics and data, all of which are tailored based on the user's needs. If time is allowed, there may be additional functionalities created involving the user, such as heatmaps for the user's favorite players, and a player draft system revolving past season results.
